				<h3><span class="text-secondary">BIO</span></h3>
                <p>Hello! I'm Madhur, a software developer.
		   	       I enjoy creating things that live on the 
				   internet, whether that be websites, applications, 
				   or anything in between. My goal is to always build products 
				   that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.
				   Shortly after graduating from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College,
				   I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a 
				   daily basis and worked with the freelancer projects, I'm a people person. 
				   I really enjoy meeting and working with a lot of different people.<br>
				   <br>
				   Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
					<ul>
					<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
					<li>HTML & (S)CSS</li>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>C</li>
					<li>Node.js</li>
					<li>Angular.js</li></ul>

                <p>I began to participate in FRC Team 3476 in 2018, and we went to World Champs for the 7th consecutive
                    time. I was on the CAD team and the manufacturing team, really creating the robot. This is my
                    first year, so not a lot. But I'm constantly getting better at what I'm doing and trying new things.

                <p>I began creating websites in 6th grade, starting off with template website creators, like Wix and
                    Weebly. But later, over the summer I learned how to make my own website with HTML and CSS. I worked
                    on a few and then made this one after forgetting for a long time. But now it works so, progress.</p>
